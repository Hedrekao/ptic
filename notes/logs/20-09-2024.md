### Keypoints:
- use of wandb for tracking experiments and hyperparameters
    - just need account on `https://wandb.ai` and create a school account
    - cool and easy sdk to use (in the notebook with tinyimagenet)
- no idea on how to do big conv networks without overfitting
    - more regularization
    - stratify data before test/val split
    - play with number of layers
    - read papers on SoTA conv nets
    - use residual path (??)
- we have so many credits on colab we can probably abuse it (only with L4, A100 is expensive af)
- in notebook there are examples how to handle image data using torch vision idk
- random thought -> maybe a multimodal model that takes both images and some very basic attributes like name and description


### Agenda next time:
- divide work (someone figma mock, someone paper reading, someone analysis -> requirements, usecases)
- explain fe mock idea
- diagram for richard together
- ask Stibo about data / azure credit??
- diagram with the flow of entire system
