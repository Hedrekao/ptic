### Keypoints:

- Training loop implemented that trains model for each internal node in hierarchy
- Model skips training for nodes with single child, saves those in metadata
- Creation of hierarchy mask matrix for final prediction probabilities
- Added helper method for visualizing hierarchy as PNG graph
- DOCUMENTATION: PR Analysis finished

### Agenda next time:

- Begin model evaluation metrics
- Implement full prediction pipeline
- Create final model combining all nodes
