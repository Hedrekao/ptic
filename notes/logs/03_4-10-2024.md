### Keypoints:
- 03.10.2024
    - frontend and backend are moving forward
    - jula is creating new components like (for uploading and dragging'n'dropping images)
    - kuba is deep into the go, doing websockets and out of order sending of image data
    - we chose a subset of imagenet net to work on
    - tomek created a scraper in go to get images from chosen categories (before we get accepted to official imagenet dataset)
    - mlac code from stibo basically does model per internal node predicting prob for each child and then going recursively and multiplying these probs
- 04.10.2024
    - basic statistics about images in python is done
    - basic preprocessing of images and saving them as tensors is written
    - imagenet scraper is more stable now

### Agenda next time:
- make golang and fe communicate with each other
- make uploading parallel in go
- do diagram for richard (**deadline before meeting on wednesday**)
- do flow diagram for us (how the data flows)
- create data loader that can also prefetch batches of tensors from disk, think about shuffling, stratifying etc
- start actual model architecture and training
